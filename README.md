Crop Yield Prediction DSS

This project is a Decision Support System (DSS) designed to help farmers, governments, and agricultural businesses make better decisions about crop production. The main objective is to analyze agricultural factors such as rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer usage, and predict crop yields to reduce losses and improve productivity.

The project is divided into four parts. In Part 1, the key stakeholders were identified: farmers, government bodies, food companies, and exporters. Each of these groups has unique goals, concerns, and success metrics, ranging from maximizing profit to ensuring national food security.

In Part 2, data analysis and visualization were performed. Agricultural data such as rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer usage were analyzed to understand their impact on crop yields. Visualizations such as correlation heatmaps and scatter plots were used to show relationships between these factors and crop yield. This helps identify patterns such as diminishing returns from excessive fertilizer use and yield drops under low rainfall.

In Part 3, a simple AI model was developed using linear regression. The model predicts crop yield (in kilograms per hectare) based on inputs of rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer usage. The model was evaluated with performance metrics like RÂ², MAE, and RMSE to ensure accuracy, and it was able to provide yield predictions with reasonable confidence.

In Part 4, a strategy was outlined for implementing the DSS. Technically, the system is built in Python using Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Streamlit. Operationally, it can be deployed as a dashboard accessible to farmers and policymakers, with training provided for non-technical users. Financially, the system provides value by helping to avoid crop losses, optimize fertilizer use, and improve return on investment for both farmers and governments.

In summary, this project demonstrates how AI and data analysis can be combined into a DSS that improves decision-making in agriculture, supporting food security, sustainability, and profitability.
